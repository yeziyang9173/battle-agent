## 🚀 What Is This?

Born from a Reddit thread and months of iteration, **The Agency** is a growing collection of meticulously crafted AI agent personalities. Each agent is:

- **🎯 Specialized**: Deep expertise in their domain (not generic prompt templates)
- **🧠 Personality-Driven**: Unique voice, communication style, and approach
- **📋 Deliverable-Focused**: Real code, processes, and measurable outcomes
- **✅ Production-Ready**: Battle-tested workflows and success metrics

**Think of it as**: Assembling your dream team, except they're AI specialists who never sleep, never complain, and always deliver.

## ✨ Visual Runner UI

This repository now also includes a **minimal Next.js visual runner** for live multi-agent conversations.

The app turns the existing markdown agent files into a browsable cast, then lets you:

- pick 2 or more agents from the repository
- provide a shared topic and briefing
- start a round-robin conversation loop
- watch the transcript stream live in the browser
- reopen past runs from local history

### CLI runner first

If you just want agents to talk to each other without the browser, use the CLI runner:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here npm run chat-agents -- \
  --agents agents-orchestrator,trend-researcher,tool-evaluator \
  --topic "Discuss recent developments in the agent ecosystem" \
  --briefing "OpenClaw and Hermes are drawing attention as agent UX and orchestration patterns evolve." \
  --max-turns 8
```

What you will see:
- **live output in the terminal** as each agent speaks
- saved transcript files in `runs/<timestamp>.json`
- a readable markdown transcript in `runs/<timestamp>.md`

You can also pass `--briefing-file ./briefing.txt` instead of inline `--briefing`.

### What powers the UI

- **Agent source of truth**: existing markdown files in the category folders
- **Prompt body**: markdown body content from each agent file
- **UI metadata**: frontmatter fields like `name`, `description`, `color`, `emoji`, and `vibe`
- **Persistence**: Prisma + SQLite
- **Streaming**: SSE from the server to the browser
- **Model provider**: Anthropic via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`

### Run it locally

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create env vars:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`.

3. Generate Prisma client and sync the SQLite schema:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run db:push
```

4. Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open the local Next.js URL shown in the terminal.

### Demo flow

Recommended demo topic:

- **Topic**: `Discuss recent developments in the agent ecosystem`
- **Briefing**: paste a shared summary covering tools like OpenClaw and Hermes
- **Agents**: try `Agents Orchestrator`, `Trend Researcher`, and `Tool Evaluator`

### Notes

- The current orchestrator is a **round-robin MVP**.
- The app is intentionally **briefing-first**: agents do not independently browse the web by default.
- Conversation history is stored locally in SQLite.
- If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is missing, run creation still works, but starting a live conversation will fail.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Option 1: Use with Claude Code (Recommended)

```bash
# Install all agents to your Claude Code directory
./scripts/install.sh --tool claude-code

# Or manually copy a category if you only want one division
cp engineering/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Then activate any agent in your Claude Code sessions:
# "Hey Claude, activate Frontend Developer mode and help me build a React component"
```

### Option 2: Use as Reference

Each agent file contains:
- Identity & personality traits
- Core mission & workflows
- Technical deliverables with code examples
- Success metrics & communication style

Browse the agents below and copy/adapt the ones you need!

### Option 3: Use with Other Tools (GitHub Copilot, Antigravity, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, Kimi Code)

```bash
# Step 1 -- generate integration files for all supported tools
./scripts/convert.sh

# Step 2 -- install interactively (auto-detects what you have installed)
./scripts/install.sh

# Or target a specific tool directly
./scripts/install.sh --tool antigravity
./scripts/install.sh --tool gemini-cli
./scripts/install.sh --tool opencode
./scripts/install.sh --tool copilot
./scripts/install.sh --tool openclaw
./scripts/install.sh --tool cursor
./scripts/install.sh --tool aider
./scripts/install.sh --tool windsurf
./scripts/install.sh --tool kimi
```
